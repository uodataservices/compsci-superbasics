If you log into a remote server (with NoMachine or Putty, for example), you'll
already have a terminal shell open, with a command line prompt waiting for your
command.

Otherwise, there are different ways to get to the command line depending on
which operating system you're using, and which application you prefer to use.
Here are the common ways.

### On Mac

You need to find the **Terminal** application and launch it. Either:

* Press <span class="key"><em>⌘</em></span><span class="wide key"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></span> (command-space to launch Spotlight)

  * then type `terminal` to find then launch the Terminal app.

or, in Finder (e.g., click on the Desktop background, or the blue Finder icon):

* Press <span class="key"><em>⌘</em></span><span class="key"><em>⇧</em></span><span class="key"><em>U</em></span> (opens the Utilities
folder)

  * then double-click on **Terminal**.

### On Windows

By default, Windows has a different shell language than Unix, PowerShell. To emulate a Unix shell on a Windows environment, we recommend [Git Bash](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git).

### On Linux

Press <span class="key"><em><sub>ctrl</sub></em></span><span class="key"><em><sub>alt</sub></em></span><span class="key"><em>T</em></span>.

### On Gnome

Press <span class="key"><em><sub>alt</sub></em></span><span class="key"><em>F2</em></span> and
type `terminal`.
